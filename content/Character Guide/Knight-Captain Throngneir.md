Knight-captain Throngneir is a hobgoblin ranger and formerly the captain of the [[Gunaraad Watch]].

Throngneir was orphaned at a young age and during his teenage years he joined the [[Umbral Vanguard]] as an initiate. Throngneir rose quickly through the ranks, striking with precision and clearing missions with an efficiency most would only dream of.  After hearing rumors of foul play after [[Count Ndwandwe]]'s purchase of [[Gunaraad]], Throngneir set himself on his next mission. Throngneir has able to easily secure his position as captain of the watch where he could keep a close eye on the goings-on of the town and expand his network into the count's circle. 

After the count started enacting increasingly draconic laws, Throngneir got in touch with the other members of the Vanguard to get help; he knew he could not take down the count alone. Throngneir fled his post fearing that if he remained any longer as the captain he might get dominated by the count, and hid among the bullywugs in [[The Croaks]]. From here, he coordinated with the bullywugs, convincing them to help act against the count.
