Bjorn is a human fighter and captain of Gunaraad's night watch. Bjorn takes a lackadaisical approach to his duty's and spends most of tour drinking the night away and regaling patrons with outlandish tales of his life as a guard captain in [[Nobleman's Rest]].

Bjorn is burly, 6 feet tall, and has a muscular build. His face has scars on it from fights in his past. His beard is unkempt and his hair tousled, it is clear Bjorn's best days are behind him.
