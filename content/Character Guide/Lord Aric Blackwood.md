Lord Aric Blackwood was a [[drow]], and the Seneschal to [[Count Ndwandwe]]. Aric spent most of his time in the keep, ruling in Ndwandwe's absence, though he did have his own manor in [[Gunaraad]].<br>
Aric trusted the systems and rules in place and would not act directly against them. Aric was a good person and did't like what the count was doing but there was little he could do about it.<br>
Blackwood wore blackened steel plate armor which bore his family crest on the chestpiece. He had a shoulder cape that was deep scarlet and had intricate black stitchings in it indicating his rank. He wore a helmet with a cowboy hat brim on it to protect his skin from the sun.<br>
Blackwood endorsed a party of adventurers to resolve some issues. While on one such mission, they returned to find him dead, presumably killed by a mindflayer. The Count used the death of Aric Blackwood to further consolidate power by blaming it on radical dissidents and using it to provide justification for his regulations and regime.<br>
Lord Aric Blackwood's ranch is operated by autognomes.<br>
