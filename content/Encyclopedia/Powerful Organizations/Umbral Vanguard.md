The Umbral Vanguard are an ancient organization of freedom fighters, who are largely responsible for the rebellion that put an end to the [[Empfehlien Empire]]. They acted in the shadows, eliminating key targets and pieces of infrastructure while empowering dissident groups.

### Structure

The Umbral Vanguard is made of several groups that work together towards their common goal. These individual groups are called Shadows. During the reign of the [[Empfehlien Empire]]there were also groups called Daggers that were more militant and would typically take out militarily strategic targets to weaken the empire while the Shadows would engage in spy work and feed information to the network.

### Public Agenda

The Umbral Vanguard are a clandestine group dedicated to undermining oppression wherever it may be found.
