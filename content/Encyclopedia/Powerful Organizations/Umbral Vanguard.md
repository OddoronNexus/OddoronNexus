### Structure

The Umbral Vanguard is made of several groups that work together towards their common goal. These individual groups are called Shadows. During the reign there were also groups called Daggers that were more militant and would typically take out militarily strategic targets to weaken the empire while the Shadows would engage in spy work and feed information to the network.

### Public Agenda
