**Description:** The Pitcher of Preference appears as an ordinary ceramic pitcher, adorned with intricate patterns and motifs that hint at its mystical nature. Despite its unassuming appearance, this enchanted pitcher holds a remarkable secret: it has the ability to pour an individual's favorite drink, tailored specifically to their tastes and preferences.

**Mechanism:** To activate the pitcher's magical properties, one must first ask the intended drinker what their favorite beverage is, and the question must be answered. Whether the response is genuine or deceitful, the pitcher will respond to the spoken words and pour forth the drinker's favorite beverage.

**Manifestation:** As the chosen beverage cascades from the pitcher's spout, it emits a faint, ethereal glow, accompanied by a tantalizing aroma that fills the air with familiarity and comfort. The liquid appears pristine and inviting, perfectly matching the flavor profile and nuances of the individual's favorite drink.

**Limitations:** The magic of the Pitcher of Preference is bound by the drinker's response. Only when the question is posed and answered does the pitcher activate, ensuring that it remains attuned to the genuine desires of its user. Attempts to deceive the pitcher with false answers or evasions will not work.
