**Description:** The Psionic Ooze appears as a small, unassuming vial crafted from clear glass, containing a swirling mass of grey alchemical ooze within its confines. Despite its unremarkable appearance, the contents within hold a mysterious and potent power, capable of altering the psionic energy around it.

**Mechanics & Inner Workings:** Upon release from the flask, the amorphous grey ooze begins its singular task: to consume psionic energy from its surroundings. As it slithers and undulates across surfaces, it emits a faint, pulsating aura that permeates the area within a 10-foot radius. Within this radius, all creatures gain resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells.

**Manifestation of Power:** The psionic ooze exhibits a remarkable ability to manipulate and absorb the latent psionic energies present in its environment. As it engulfs and feeds upon these energies, it undergoes a subtle transformation, its semi-translucent form pulsating with ethereal waves of energy.

**Planar Shift:** After exactly 1 minute of consuming psionic energy, the ooze undergoes a sudden and inexplicable transformation. With a disorienting ripple, it planeshifts itself to a far realm beyond the mortal plane, leaving behind naught but a lingering echo of its presence.
