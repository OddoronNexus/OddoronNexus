**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered diamond)

You channel magical energy to disrupt the invisibility magic in the area around you. Each creature within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you that is currently invisible is affected by this spell. Any ongoing invisibility effects on these creatures are dispelled, rendering them visible once again.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
