**Ancotar's Lesser Chameleon**<br>

_3rd-level illusion_<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br>  
**Range:** Touch  <br>
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of chameleon skin)  <br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You blend the ambient light around you, causing it to distort and camouflage the presence of a willing creature. That creature becomes partially invisible, blending into the surroundings. This effect grants the following benefits:

- **Partial Invisibility:** The affected creature gains partial invisibility, making it blend into its surroundings. Creatures affected by this spell have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, attacks against them have disadvantage if the attacker isn't using special senses.
    
- **Limited Concealment:** While under the effects of this spell, affected creatures appear translucent and indistinct, making them difficult to target accurately. Creatures have a +2 bonus to AC.    

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the affected creature also gains the benefits of invisibility.
