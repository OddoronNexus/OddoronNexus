Aleswell is a small settlement about a day's worth of travel away from [[Gunaraad]]. Aleswell has only a few residents, a small farm, a lamb pen and an inn. Most of the settlement's money and supplies pass through the inn itself, which gets its stock from the farm and traders passing through.

A wood elf wizard lives in the nearby [[Fort Caractacus]], named [[Ancotar]]. He is mostly solitary but occasionally emerges to get himself some food and supplies. The people of Aleswell are generally untrustworthy of Ancotar, especially after he turned them all invisible, but are not outright hostile towards him.
