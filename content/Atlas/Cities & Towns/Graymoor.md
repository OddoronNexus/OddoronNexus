The city of Graymoor is the capital of the [[County of Evershade]]. The city of Graymoor was carved into the sides of a mountain and supports a large population. The town's river allows for fishing, and the terraced mountainside yields an abundance of farmland for food production.  A port connects the city to the rest of the world via the river, and the mountainous terrain make the city very defensible, giving the population a stable lifestyle.
## Geography
The city of Graymoor is built into the mountains of the [[Twilight Peaks]], and has a river running through it. There are several caves in the mountain in and around the town that have ideal conditions for growing forced rhubarb with their cool, dark interiors and controlled temperatures. The land alongside the river through Graymoor has been terraced to allow farms.
## [[Graymoor Ale]]
The city of Graymoor is renowned for its ale, which it exports in copious quantities and is a key source of revenue for the city. Despite being called and named ale, the town's famous drink is not, in fact, ale. Graymoor Ale is a rhubarb liqueur made from forced rhubarb grown in the caves.
