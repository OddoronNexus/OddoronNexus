The town's economic vitality is primarily driven by the cultivation and sale of its diverse array of crops and associated products. Notably, Momadar boasts an extensive production of kiwano and durian fruits, which stand as emblematic staples of its agricultural output.

Worshipper of Verdannis wear a headdress called a Verdannisian Husk made from the hollowed-out shell of the largest kiwanos or other materials fashioned to look like a kiwano.<br>
Momadar also harbors a secretive sect devoted to the worship of [[Zirbethinus]], a god of hidden knowledge, durians, and another aspect of Fruitspinner. The followers of this cult are mostly sentient skitterpups who adopt an intelligent persona when wearing the sacred headdress of their cult, the Durian Crown. Crafted from the spiky husks of durian fruits or fashioned from other materials to mimic their appearance, these headdresses are enchanted such that when worn, the wearer is disguised, and not recognizable as the same

Rival town that's very similar but with centipedes and it's prickly pears and lychees.
All the spiked fruit gods are different aspects of the same god, and he put the whole thing up for his own amusement.

In the eccentric town of Momadar, nestled amidst rolling hills and sprawling kiwano orchards, the locals lead lives intertwined with the peculiarities of their environment. Cockroach pets are a common sight, but here they're not just pests; they're cherished companions, trained to fetch, roll over, and even play fetch like loyal dogs. But what truly sets Momadar apart are its inhabitants' fashion choices — oversized hats resembling the exotic kiwano fruit crown their heads, while their cloaks, fashioned from the iridescent wings of cockroaches, add a dash of flair to their attire.<br>
Religion in Momadar revolves around the worship of the Kiwano God, a deity believed to watch over the bountiful kiwano harvests and bless the town with prosperity. The mayor himself, a devout cleric of the Kiwano God, leads ceremonies and casts spells centered around the spiked fruit, ensuring its continued abundance.<br>
However, beneath the surface tranquility lies a web of intrigue. A clandestine cult of highly intelligent cockroaches, masquerading as mere insects, has taken root within Momadar. These enigmatic creatures, equipped with enchanted helmets crafted from hollowed durians, hide their true nature from prying eyes. They revere a deity known as the Durian God, and their ultimate goal is nothing short of toppling the Kiwano God from his divine pedestal.<br>
Across the hills lies Momadar's rival town, Suncrest, populated not by cockroaches but by centipedes. Here, prickly pears and lychees reign supreme, and the inhabitants share a similar devotion to their own spiked fruit deity. Strangely enough, despite their differences, both towns worship aspects of the same divine entity, a whimsical god who finds amusement in the rivalry between his fruit-themed followers.<br>
As tensions simmer between the two towns, the cockroach cult in Momadar conducts covert operations, gathering intelligence on their kiwano-worshipping neighbors. With each passing day, the stage is set for a showdown between believers of the Kiwano God and the cunning adherents of the Durian God, all under the amused gaze of their capricious deity.<br>In the heart of Momadar, amid the bustling marketplace where vendors peddle kiwano-inspired trinkets and cockroach-themed crafts, a rumor swirls like a whisper on the wind. It's said that hidden within the labyrinthine alleys lies a forgotten temple, a sanctuary where the secrets of the Kiwano God are said to be inscribed upon ancient tablets of prickly pear parchment.<br>
But the path to enlightenment is fraught with peril, for the temple's guardians are not mortal beings but sentient centipedes, sworn protectors of their prickly pear deity's mysteries. Clad in armor woven from lychee husks and wielding spears tipped with hardened cactus spines, these formidable guardians stand vigilant against any who would dare trespass upon their sacred domain.<br>
Meanwhile, in the shadowy depths of Momadar's orchards, the cockroach cult carries out their clandestine operations with meticulous precision. Armed with enchanted helmets that obscure their true identities, they infiltrate the highest echelons of society, whispering secrets and sowing discord amongst the faithful followers of the Kiwano God.<br>
But as tensions escalate and the rivalry between the two towns reaches a fever pitch, whispers of a prophecy begin to spread. It is said that only through unity — a merging of cockroach and centipede, kiwano and prickly pear — can the divine prankster be appeased and harmony restored to the land.<br>
And so, amidst the chaos and intrigue, a fragile alliance begins to take shape, as unlikely allies set aside their differences in pursuit of a greater truth. For in the end, perhaps the greatest mystery of all is the revelation that even the most bitter of rivals may ultimately share a common destiny, bound together by the whims of a god who delights in chaos and revels in the absurdity of mortal affairs.
