The Veiled Sepulcher is an abandoned church situated amid [[Aurora's Atoll]]'s coastline mangrove woodlands. This old building is now in ruins and is shrouded in moss and thick vegetation. The church is surrounded by a large cemetery that is always covered in fog, full of dilapidated tombstones and once-proud mausoleums. There are rumors that the mangrove phantoms—spectral beings that prowl the shadows—came from this area. Only the bravest of hearts dare enter the Veiled Sepulcher, a realm of mystery and fear where legends whisper of arcane rituals and restless spirits.
