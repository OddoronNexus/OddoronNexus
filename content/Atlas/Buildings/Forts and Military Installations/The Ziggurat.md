The Ziggurat is an ancient [[Empfehlien Empire|Imperial]] military research facility on the island of [[Gatiden]]. It housed the [[Soul Forge]] which is where the golems that formed the [[Dread Guard]] were created. A man died preventing the rebels from gaining further access into the ziggurat and was resurrected as a scream thief who haunted this location. A golem, and former member of the Dread Guard who regretted joining, stands guard before the Soul Forge, determined to prevent it from ever being used again.
