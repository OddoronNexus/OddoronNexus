The Ziggurat was an ancient [[Empfehlien Empire|Imperial]] military research facility on the island of [[Gatiden]]. It housed the [[Soul Forge]] which was where the golems that formed the [[Dread Guard]] were created. A man died preventing the rebels from gaining further access into the ziggurat and was resurrected as a scream thief who haunted this location. A golem, and former member of the Dread Guard who regretted joining, stood guard before the Soul Forge, determined to prevent it from ever being used again.<br>
A group of individuals, including [[Arokoris]], [[Amorphous Hobblehobble]], and [[Lorn Ironroot]] encountered [[Ancotar]] attempting to turn himself into a golem. These travelers interfered, stopping the ritual and disabling the soul forge. Then, with the help of some dwarves, they destroyed the Ziggurat, erasing its mark on the world.
