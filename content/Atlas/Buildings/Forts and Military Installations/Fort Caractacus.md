Fort Caractacus is an ancient fort built by the [[Empfehlien Empire]] on the island of [[Empfehlos]]. The fort is near the small settlement of [[Aleswell]] and is currently home to the wizard [[Ancotar]].

Though much of the fort's historical defenses and passages have collapsed due to the procession of time, enough of the fort remains to serve as shelter and provide a space for Ancotar's experiments.
