Fort Caravella is a historic fortress, which once belonged to the [[Empfehlien Empire]], situated on [[Aurora's Atoll]]. This fortress was a significant trading center, known for its strong walls and detailed stonework. Positioned strategically overlooking the sea, Fort Caravella served as a bustling hub for commerce, where merchant ships from distant lands would dock to trade exotic goods and valuable resources. Today, the fortress stands in disrepair, a reminder of its former glory. Decaying docks, worn battlements, and faded frescoes showcasing the empire's rich history provide a glimpse into a prosperous and adventurous era long gone.
