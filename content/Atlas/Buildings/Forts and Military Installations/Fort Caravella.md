Fort Caravella is a historic fortress, which once belonged to the [[Empfehlien Empire]], situated on [[Aurora's Atoll]]. This fortress was a significant trading center, known for its strong walls and detailed stonework. Positioned strategically overlooking the sea, Fort Caravella served as a bustling hub for commerce, where merchant ships from distant lands would dock to trade exotic goods and valuable resources. Today, the fortress stands in disrepair, a reminder of its former glory. Decaying docks, worn battlements, and faded frescoes showcasing the empire's rich history provide a glimpse into a prosperous and adventurous era long gone.<br>
The fort is overseen by a Vizier. There is an elder named Edgar who is 1000 years old and is sensitive about his age, becoming belligerent whenever someone calls him old. This elder had some bowel issues which was resolved after [[Lorn Ironroot]] gave him a laxative made from [[Puckering Puffcap]].
