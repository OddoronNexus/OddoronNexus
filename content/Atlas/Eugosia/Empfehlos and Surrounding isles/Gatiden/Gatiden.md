The island of Gatiden is off the northeastern coast of the island [[Empfehlos]] and is separated from Empfehlos by a one mile wide channel known as the [[Narrow Depths]]. Gatiden is roughly 350 square miles in size, and is mostly dominated by the swampy region known as [[The Croaks]].<br>
Gatiden is home to the to the settlements of [[Gunaraad]], [[Lashtarl's Lantern]], and [[Sandsorrow Refuge]], and is the sole territory of the County of Gatiden, currently ruled by [[Count Ndwandwe]].<br>
Though few live to remember it, Gatiden contained a key military and arcane research facility during the height of the [[Empfehlien Empire]], [[The Ziggurat]]. Within this ziggurat, imperial scientists engaged in profane research and the soul forge was kept. Some ancient scripts even seem to imply the soul forge could fetch souls from people's bodies and bind them to statues, turning them into golems.
