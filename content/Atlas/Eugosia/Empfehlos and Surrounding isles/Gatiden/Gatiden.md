The island of Gatiden is off the northeastern coast of the island [[Empfehlos]] and is separated by a one mile wide channel known as the [[Narrow Depths]]. Gatiden is roughly 350 square miles in size, and is mostly dominated by the swampy region known as [[The Croaks]], which covers most of the island.
