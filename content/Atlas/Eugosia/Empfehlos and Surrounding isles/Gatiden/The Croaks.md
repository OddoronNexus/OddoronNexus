# The Croaks

The Croaks is a large swamp region East of [[Gunaraad]] on the island of [[Gatiden]]. The Croaks are named after the sounds of the bullywug tribe that inhabits the region. Currently, despite being under the de jure rule of [[Count Ndwandwe]], [[King Taagod]] is the de facto ruler of this area.
