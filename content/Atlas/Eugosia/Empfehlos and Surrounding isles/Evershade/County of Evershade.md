The County of Evershade occupies the Eastern portion of the tip of the island [[Empfehlos]]. The Northern half of the county is bounded by a mountain range named the [[Twilight Peaks]] which runs north-south and curves to run east-west. The area between these mountains and the coast is named [[Sunscorch Plains]] and is arid, and home to a nomadic giant tribe named the [[Sunspear Clan]]. Within the mountains, there is a town called [[Graymoor]] which produced a renowned ale but for one reason or another, the production of this ale has ceased. The island of [[Gatiden]] is separated from the county of Evershade in the southeast by a one-mile wide channel known as the [[Narrow Depths]]. A small settlement known as [[Aleswell]] is a few miles inland from this channel and is about one day's worth of travel from both [[Gunaraad]] and Graymoor. An ancient aqueduct runs from the mountains to the settlement of Aleswell, and this aqueduct, along with the mountain range, forms Evershade's land border.  An ancient military fort named [[Fort Caractacus]] is a few miles outside of Aleswell, and most of the southern portion of the county is filled with dense forests. An ancient road connects Aleswell to Graymoor, Gunaraad, and [[Wynthorne]].
